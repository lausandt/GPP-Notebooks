    "## Structured programming (control flow) \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "With structured programming, a developer uses no more than three basic control structures to structure the code. Large blocks of code are avoided by the use of these abstractions in conjunction with a hierarchy of procedures. This might sound a bit opaque, but it is the way we all program. No matter if we programme in Python, C, or Haskell, We use only three basic control structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequencing: statements are executed one after the other in a specific order. In Python, this is achieved by indentation, a semicolon, or simply a new line.\n",
    "2. selection: choice: if B, then S1; otherwise, S2. Here B is a boolean and S is a statement (a single executable instance). \n",
    "3. repetition through iteration: where you have the condition check in advance or afterwards (while B does S) and (do S until B) and/or repetition through recursion: repeated calling of a procedure until some base case is met.\n",
    " \n",
    "One of the great results of programming language theory, the Böhm-Jacopini theorem, proves that we need no more than these three to compute any computable function. For anyone creating programmes larger than a few lines of code, it is imperative to have a good understanding of the control structures. In this notebook, I will expound on these three structures and on other tools Python gives you to increase the structure of your programming. For instance, closures, context managers, and the `else` keyword. Some of these subjects I want to investigate in depth; some pass over quite quickly as they are not well suited to Python, e.g., recursion."

An expression is a syntactic entity in a programming language that may be evaluated to determine its value. \n",

    "#### **Iteration**\n",
    "Iteration is the main subject of this notebook. I will show you what iteration means in detail, what a generator is in Python, and how you can create your own iterators and let Python do it for you. We even take a look at laziness; when using laziness, we can even have an infinite number of repetitions. Finally, we look at the functional programming tools in the itertools and functools modules that allow you to use iteration concepts as building blocks to build increasingly more powerful algorithms.\n",

    "Iteration is the technique of marking out a block of statements within a computer program for a defined number of repetitions. \n",

    "How did I make this class iterable? By implementing the special methods `__getitem__` and `__len__`, I have implemented the [sequence interface](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc). The sequence interface is a subclass of the iterable interface. Python allows you to do this form of super simple interface implementation; it is called DuckTyping. By implementing a the required methods of sequence, I have implemented the interface. Duck Typing is one of Python's best features, yet also one of its worst, of course, depending on who you talk to. I am on the fence here. I do appreciate the flexibility Duck Typing offers, but I also appreciate the errors that come with it. See the standard Python example of Duck Typing: "

    "#### Parametric Polymorphism\n",
    "We have seen an example of inclusion polymorphism via subclassing. In a language like Haskell or SML, you have a concept called parametric polymorphism, which refers to code that is written without knowledge of the actual type of the arguments; the code is parametric in the type of the parameter. We have already seen an example of this in Python with amongst others, the `swap` function, but let me start with some code in Haskell and then show you the advantage in Python by redefining the standard `range` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Haskell, we can write a range function as such:\n",
    "```\n",
    "range :: (Num a, Enum a) => a -> a -> a -> [a]\n",
    "range start stop step = [start, step + start..stop]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function is parametric in type; `a` is a generic type. `a` is bound by two type classes: 'Enum', which defines operations on sequentially ordered types, and 'Num', which defines operations on basic number types. It does not matter what you feed this function as long as these constraints are met. The function is polymorphic in the parameters it takes.\n",

    "#### Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating the question over and over is called recursion. Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. Recursion is the twin of induction, with induction being a mathematical technique to construct proofs. A statement P ( n ) P(n) is true for every natural number n, that is, that the infinitely many cases $P ( 0 ) , P ( 1 ) , P ( 2 ) , P ( 3 ) , … $  all hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "A proof by induction consists of two cases. The first, the base case, proves the statement for $n = 0$  without assuming any knowledge of other cases. The second case, the induction step, proves that if the statement holds for any given case $n = k$ then it must also hold for the next case $n = k + 1$ I started this notebook with the claim that you only need three basic control structures to compute anything that is computable. This was proven by Bohm and Jacopini; for their proof, they used induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer programming, proof by [structural induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_induction) is often used. The same ideas we find in recursion: you define a base case or more base cases and make a recursive call until you hit the base case, after which you compute the result on the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case in the `factorial` function is simply 1. Once we have reached the base case, we end the recursion. We can also have more base cases; the famous `fibonacci` function has two base cases, 0 and 1."

    "#### Expecting exceptions\n",
    "You will see this kind of code quite often. For instance, when you open a database connection, acquire a lock or network service. With these operations, the chance of an error occurring increases exponentially. We want to catch the error and continue running our program instead of crashing.\n",

    "Running this code with an external resource is problematic; catching the error does not release the resource. Having the resource not released can lead to very specific, hard-to-debug problems. You can lock someone out of a thread they need by not releasing the lock, you can slow down database and network connections by keeping unused connections open (memory leakage). You can prevent file access by keeping the file open. If there is a policy that only one process can write to a file at a time, which there should be, you can block the operation of an entire program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For file, network, database, and concurrent operations, you need to use the keyword finally and explicitly tear down the resource you used.\n",

    "This code is a bit hard to understand. We have taken a regular print statement and reversed the print order, but only within the context of the code block, starting with the `with` keyword. Let's look at it point-for-point:\n",
    "1. Python invokes the special method `__enter__`\n",
    "2. We capture the actual sys.stdout.write (which is a method, and as argument has text) and save it so we can restore it later.\n",
    "3. We [monkey patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) sys.stdout. write with our own method. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5626193/what-is-monkey-patching \n",
    "4. We have named a target variable `wtf` with the as keyword; returning this gives `wtf` a value, namely 'and George'.\n",
    "5. A simple function that reverses the value it is given.\n",
    "6. Python calls the special method `__exit__` with None, None, None. It knows to do this because we have executed `reverse_write`.\n",
    "7. We set the original value of sys.stdout.write back\n",
    "8. If there was an error to propagate, it gets handled now.\n",
    "9. returns True, so the interpreter knows the error was caught.\n",
    " \n",
    "When the context we have just created runs in runtime, every call to print('text') will print that text reversed. If there are no more calls to print, control is given back to the regular runtime. \n",
