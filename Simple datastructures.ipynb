    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "A data structure is a structure for the organisation, management, and storage of data. The choice of data structure determines the efficiency, correctness, and testability (ease of) of programs. \n",
    "Python knows many data structures, from simple to very complex. However despite the built-in riches, most junior & medior programmers will opt for the list as data structure, the list is flexible and knows an application programming interface (API) full with useful methods. However, the list is often not the right choice as data structure it isn't even the \"Pythonic\" choice (recommended by Python itself) for data structure that would be the tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "What data structure you should use depends on what you want to achieve with that data structure. For instance, if needs to be fast, should the data structure only contain unique elements, should the content of your data structure never change, you want to able to order the elements fast, or store it in a specific order? These are the type of questions you need to ask yourselves while make a choice of data structure. You've probably guessed it, but a list is the wrong answer to all these questions.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will discuss the five easiest data structure Python has. Give you an understanding when to use them and when not. The simple datastructures that all Python programmers should know are in order of discussion & complexity:\n",
    " 1. set \n",
    " 2. tuple\n",
    " 3. list \n",
    " 4. array \n",
    " 5. dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "All five are a direct or indirect subclass of the collections class https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html. Set is a direct subclass, tuple, list, and array are subclasses of Sequence (to quote Luciano Ramalho of FPY: Python loves sequences) and dictionary is a subclass of Mappings.\n"

    "So why not always use array? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well because they are inflexible and wieldy in use. For instance, you cannot have multiple types in array, in fact you can only have numeric types see https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html. You can't endlessly expand arrays without losing the benefit of adjacent memory blocks. When you create an array of say five elements, the compiler assigns a free block of memory that is bigger than you asked for, say enough to house 10 elements. This to allow for some flexibility. However, after the 11th element is added the compiler will either have to assign a new memory block to the array with all elements or add another not adjacent memory block. The former is expensive the latter loses you the advantage of adjacent memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when to use an array? Use it if you have a large number (and I mean large at least a few million) of numeric values you want to do operations on, then you can really make use of the speed an array has to offer.\n"
