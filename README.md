# Programming in Python

These notebooks contain information on programming in Python in general, the subjects in these notebooks or on general programming concepts and how Python implements these. These notebooks are part of a three-part series of notebooks on Python, Programming in Python, Object-Oriented Programming and Advanced Programming Python. 

Originally, these notebooks were written for my partner, she retrained as a data engineer, but the Python course she received was not of great quality. I trained in computer science at university and this is my attempt to it better. At university I trained in Java, JavaScript, and Haskell. It is fair to say that I am not a Pythonista nor an expert in the language. So, I leaned on people who are experts in Python. Foremost Luciano Ramalho who authored an excellent book called Fluent in Python, but also Python doc and numerous PEPs which is great for understanding the reasoning behind the language. 

Thanks to Lucianoâ€™s (and others) excellent work my own understanding of Python left the academical and moved to the practical. Where at my university circles Python is not highly regarded, I now do regard it highly, as flexible, fast to code, fast to a solution language. My only disappointment with the language is that it never will be a functional language, but no matter in these notebooks we discuss object-oriented programming specific to Python. 

The order in which these notebooks on Python programming should be read is arbitrary, but if you must have an order, try:
 - 
 - 

Finally, if you haphazardly stumble on the notebooks and you see mistakes, want to discuss points, please feel free to contact me on:
