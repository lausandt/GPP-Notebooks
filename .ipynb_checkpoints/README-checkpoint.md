# Programming in Python


The order in which these notebooks on Python programming should be read is arbitrary, but if you must have an order, try:

 - Five simple data structures
 - Structured programming
 - Concepts of programming 
 - Decorators & Data classes


Finally, if you haphazardly stumble on the notebooks and you see mistakes, want to discuss points, please feel free to contact me on:
